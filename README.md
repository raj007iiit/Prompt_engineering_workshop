## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Understand the **RTAFCE** structure for strong prompts  
- Engineer **context** to control tone, audience, medium, and purpose  
- Use **Verbalized Sampling (VS)** to increase diversity and creativity  
- Apply a **toolchain workflow** (PromptTessor / Quartzite → RA-iPromptingToolkit → ChatGPT → Perplexity)  
- Evaluate prompts for risks such as vagueness, clichés, bias, and platform mismatch  
- Produce responsible, platform-aware AI-generated media content

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 **RTAFCE Framework**
- **R**ole  
- **T**ask  
- **A**udience  
- **F**ormat  
- **C**onstraints  
- **E**xamples  

### 🔹 **Context Engineering**
Designing the background, expectations, and medium in which the AI’s response will live.

### 🔹 **Verbalized Sampling (VS)**
Prompting the model to:
- explore distributions  
- generate multi-style outputs  
- reveal low-probability creative ideas  
- avoid predictable or “safe” mode-collapse responses

## 📱 Usage (Mobile-First Activity)

Students can complete the entire activity using:
- WhatsApp / Telegram group  
- Google Docs / Notepad  
- Padlet / online boards  

No chart paper or laptops required.  
Each group selects a weak prompt and rewrites it using the five-step workflow.
